# YourFood

## ML-Powered recommendations for restaurants.

### About

I created YourFood for my senior research project at Thomas Jefferson HSST. After seeing the power of machine learning recommendation engines, I aspired to create my own recommendation system for restaurants. YourFood consists of a backend server hosted by PythonAnywhere that creates the recommendations and an iOS companion app that interacts with the user.
